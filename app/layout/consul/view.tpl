							OUR CONSULTATION PROCESS
						</h2>
						<p>
							At Artisan Rug Gallery we think the most important factorts that you need to think about in purchasing a hand-made rug are threefold: do you like it? Are the colors going to work for you? And will this fit within your budget? If the answer is yes, then it is time to take a closer look. When looking at a handmade rug, remember that a quality carpet is more than just a high knot count and high-quality materials but also dye technique, the number of colors used, the sophistication of design, and whether you, the consumer, enjoy the rug!
