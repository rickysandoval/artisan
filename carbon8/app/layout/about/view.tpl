							Our galleries are a premier source of new and antique, one-of-a-kind hand-woven rugs, located throughout the Rocky Mountains. Our central 
							location is in Crested Butte, CO with stores in both Denver and Bozeman, MT. We offer a select group of distinguished antique rugs in a broad range of styles—from the luxurious weavings of the Q’ashqai Tribe of Southern Iran to the most intricate and finely woven Tabriz, Oushak and Mamluk court 
							carpets, as well as a variety of exceptional contemporary pieces. You’ll find the fine weavings of exclusive manufacturers such as Tufenkian, Zollanvari, Megerian, Tamarian, New Moon, Woven Legends, and Tibet Rug Company.
