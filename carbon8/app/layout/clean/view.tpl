							DAILY MAINTANCE

						<p>
							When spills occur, dilute with plenty of water. Next, blot from the edge of the spill toward the center. Avoid rubbing the area. For solid spills, take a spoon and carefully scoop up the material. It is always best to attack the spill immediately. It is ok to use a very mild diluted detergent (no bleaches or alkalis) or diluted white vinegar on wool, but be careful and always follow up with water.
