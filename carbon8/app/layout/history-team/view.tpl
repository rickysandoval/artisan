							OUR EXPERIENCES
						</h2>
						<p>
							The origins of the store go back more than 25 years, when owner Jeff Deutsch traded a pair of climbing shoes, a Swatch watch, and some T-shirts in Ecuador for a small collection of handicrafts. He returned to Crested Butte, Colorado and began selling the treasures at Christmas, 1990. The trip sparked many more like it to the Andes, Central America and Middle East. Soon a successful business was born and Jeff opened a permanent store selling his exotic finds from around the world. Over the years, the folk art, weavings, jewelry and clothing disappeared and the focus became hand woven rugs. Jeff and his wife Tiffany continued to travel and learn about the business and art of making fine artisanal carpets along the way.
