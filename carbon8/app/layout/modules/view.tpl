							The PRocess 
						</h2>
						<p>
							Every part of the rug making process is considered an art from the care of the sheep to the final stage of washing and finishing the carpet. First, the finest wool is sheared from the sheep, it is then washed to free it of excess lanolin, and carded, to straighten the wool before it is spun. Next the wool is dyed by a dye-master up to twenty times in boiling vats and then hung to dry. The finest quality rugs have the most consistent color, with only subtle variation in the abrash which is due to how evenly the yarn bundle was 
							penetrated by the dye. A superior quality handmade rug cannot be made in a sweatshop as the quality can only come from a master craftsman who has a vast depth of weaving knowledge. Some master weavers use a rug script which dictates different traditional rug designs, but many weavers weave from the collective memory of their ancestors.

								Formed by families in village homes and neighbors in

As fingers fly through woolen threads, sometimes the room buzzes with social chatter, sometimes there is a meditative silence and the quiet rhythm of hands and wool. Each artisan is a master of their ancient craft.
