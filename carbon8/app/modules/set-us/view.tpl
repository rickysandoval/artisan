							WHAT SETS ARTISAN RUG 
							GALLERY APART?
						</h2>
						<p>
							At Artisan Rug Gallery we strive to bring you the best experience possible. 
							Purchasing a rug for your home should be a pleasant experience. Owner Jeff Deutsch and his knowledgeable, friendly staff respond to the unique challenges and aesthetic needs of each client, from those purchasing a single rug to experienced designers building large collections. We pride ourselves on our ability to obtain virtually any rug to satisfy any style. With a particular eye for detail and an intimate and complete knowledge of the inventory of the store, Jeff and his qualified staff can help you select a rug that adds warmth, depth, pattern and color to your home, one that will inherently speak of the history, culture and art of its origin.
