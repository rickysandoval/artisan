                        <h2>Our history </h2>
                        <p>The origins of the store go back more than 25 years, with owner Jeff Deutsch making his way to Ecuador in 1990 to trade his own personal possessions for a small collection of handicrafts. The trip sparked many more like it - from the Andes, to Central America and the Middle East. Soon as successful business was born and Jeff opened a permanent store, selling his exotic finds from around the world.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, the folk art, weaving, jewellry and clothing disappeared and the focus became hand woven rugs. Jeff and his wife Tiffany continued to travel and learn about the business and art of making fine artisanal carpets along the way. Today Artisan Rug Gallery in both Denver and Crested Butte is well establsihed as one of the best rug shops in the Rockies and Beyond.</p>
