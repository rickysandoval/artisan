    <p>Once you've found the perfect rug for your home, you're going to want to take care of it. Luckily, find hand made rugs
        hold up much better to life than a machine made one. We want to give you the knowledge to care for your new purchase,
        so here are some tips to keep your rug vibrant and strong for years to come.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <span class="num">1.</span>Vacuum Your Carpet
    </h3>
    <p>The first step towards long-lasting beauty, comfort, and durability with your carpet is to vacuum it regularly. This
        prevents soil form becoming embedded in the carpet's pile. Always vacuum and clean in the direction of the pile to
        avoid pulling up fibers and damaging knots. Also, if you can raise the beater bar on your vacuum so that the spinning
        brush is not touching the rug.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <span class="num">2.</span>Use a Spoon For Fresh Spills
    </h3>
    <p>Spills should be treated directly by scooping the stain from your carpet with a round spoon. Always move in the direction
        of the pile and not against it! After removing as much of the stain as possible with your spoon, you can pour salt
        over the spot which will absorb the liquid like a sponge. Once the salt has soaked up the liquid, use the spoon again
        to pick up the remaining and rinse the spot with a moist towel. Once dry, vacuum up any leftovers.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <span class="num">3.</span>Take Care of Loose Threads
    </h3>
    <p>If there are any loose threads in your carpet do not despair. Each knot in a hand woven rugs is cut by hand, and so sometimes
        there are threads that are left longer than the rest. Don't try to pull them out because you might pull the whole
        knot with it. Use a pair of sharp scissors to remove the extra thread down to the length of the rest of the pile.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <span class="num">4.</span>Carpets In Sunlight
    </h3>
    <p>If your carpet is placed in the full sunlight it is important to rotate it every now and then so that any spots that
        are more exposed than others do not result in a difference in colors over time. Natural dyes are less susceptible
        to fading, but any material left in direct strong sunlight will fade with time. Rotating the rug is an important
        precaution that will allow the colors to stay even over the course of the rugs life.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <span class="num">5.</span>Storage And Moving
    </h3>
    <p>Roll your carpet when you want to store or move it. This prevents creases and folds from forming that can be pesky to
        remove without a professional cleaning/soaking. Store your rug in a cool, dry, dark place to protect against moisture
        and uneven sunlight.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <span class="num">6.</span>Once a Year
    </h3>
    <p>Vacuum the back of your carpet every year to remove dust from the bottom of the knots that settles over time.</p>
    <h3>
        <span class="num">7.</span>The Important Donâ€™ts
    </h3>
    <p>Don't use chemical cleaning products on your carpet. Don't use a lot of water when you clean stains. And don't vacuum
        against the pile. For hard to remove stains, it's best to trust the experts.
    </p>

    <h3>
        <span class="num">7.</span>Get a Professional Cleaning
    </h3>
    <p>Even with the best care, it's still a good idea to get your rugs professionally cleaned every 12-24 months, depending
        on the amount of dirt and stains it's been exposed to. Give us a call at
