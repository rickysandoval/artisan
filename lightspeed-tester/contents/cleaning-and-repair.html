                    <h2>Rug Cleaning</h2>
                    <p>Whether you're dealing with spills and stains or just regular cleaning, we work with cleaners who have
                        the experience to get the job done right on your handmade rug. High quality carpets resist staining
                        better than machine made rugs with cheap dyes.
