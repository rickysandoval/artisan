            </div>
            <div class="service__description">At Artisan Rug Gallery we think the most important factors that you need to think about in purchasing a hand-made rug are threefold: do you like it? Are the colors going to work for you? And will this fit within your budget? If the answer is yes, then it is time to take a closer look. When looking at a handmade rug, remember that a quality carpet is more than just a high knot count and high-quality materials but also dye technique, the number of colors used, the sophistication of design, and whether you, the consumer, enjoy the rug!</div>

        <h2>Rug Pads</h2>
        <div class="service__description">A quality pad under your rug helps protect it from dirt, slippage, and wear on the bottom of the rug, which is actually more important to protect as it is the source of the knots. We carry two different styles of pad and can suggest the appropriate one for your rug and home and have one custom cut to your size.</div>

        <h2>Repar and Restporation</h2>
        <div class="service__description">Old and antique rugs sometimes need to be restored, and just about any damage can be fixed by the right professionals. For these matters it is imperative to seek out experienced hands. The cleaners/repairmen we use are among the best, so feel free to work through us.</div>
